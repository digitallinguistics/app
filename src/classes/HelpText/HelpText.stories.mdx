# Help Text

Help Text is used to explain the purpose of fields or controls. It should typically appear below the field, unless it is a multi-item field, in which case it should appear above.

  <p class='help-text'>This is a paragraph of help text with a <a class='link' href='#'>link</a> inside it.</p>
