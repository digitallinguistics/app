# App Shell

This folder contains all the code and components for the top-level app shell, _except_ the HTML (which lives in `src/index.hbs`) and the entry point for the app shell's CSS (`src/index.less`). The app shell (including its HTML, CSS, and JS) can be thought of as the programming environment within which the rest of the app's pages and components operate.
